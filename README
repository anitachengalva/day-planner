Hello! This is Homework Assignment #5
The task is to create a Work Day Planner

I have utilized HTML, CSS, and jQuery as well as implementing Moment.js

This planner displays the current date at the top of the page.
It also displays time blocks, in increments of an hour, which have the ability to be clicked on and edited.
And lastly, it has a feature to save the user input to local storage.

The time blocks in the past are gray, whereas timeblocks in the future are green.
Current timeblocks will be red.
